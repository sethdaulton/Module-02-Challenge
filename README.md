# Module-02-Challenge

## Description 

For this challenge I was tasked with building a portfolio page from scratch. This portfolio page will be used in the future to feature projects that I have completed for the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp. 

My portfolio page is divided up into several sections: "About Me", "Work", "Contact", and "CV".
